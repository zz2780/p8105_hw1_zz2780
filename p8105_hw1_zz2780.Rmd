Problem 1
```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

This data includes the species, year (2007-2009), and sex of penguins and island they live in. It also includes each penguin's bill length (mm), bill depth (mm), flipper length (mm), and body mass (g).

The data has `r nrow(penguins)` rows and `r ncol(penguins)` columns.

The mean flipper length is `r mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm=TRUE)` mm.

Code for mean flipper length
```{r}
mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm=TRUE)
```
Scatterplot of flipper length and bill length
```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=bill_length_mm, y=flipper_length_mm, color=species))+geom_point()
ggsave("scatter_plot.pdf", height=4, width=6)
```
