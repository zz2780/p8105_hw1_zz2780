Problem 1

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

This data includes the species, year (2007-2009), and sex of penguins
and island they live in. It also includes each penguin’s bill length
(mm), bill depth (mm), flipper length (mm), and body mass (g).

The data has 344 rows and 8 columns.

The mean flipper length is 200.9152047 mm.

Code for mean flipper length

``` r
mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm=TRUE)
```

    ## [1] 200.9152

Scatterplot of flipper length and bill length

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=bill_length_mm, y=flipper_length_mm, color=species))+geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

Problem 2

``` r
df1 = tibble(
  a=rnorm(10),
  b=a>0,
  c = c("AA","BB","CC","DD","EE","FF","GG","HH","II","JJ"),
  d= factor(c("MID", "HIGH", "LOW", "LOW", "HIGH", "MID", "MID", "HIGH", "LOW", "MID"))
)
```

Mean of each variable

``` r
#Mean of numeric variable
mean(df1$a)
```

    ## [1] -0.3819416

``` r
#Mean of logical variable
mean(df1$b)
```

    ## [1] 0.4

``` r
#Mean of character variable
mean(df1$c)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(df1$c): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
#Mean of factor variable
mean(df1$d)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(df1$d): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

It works when I tried to take the mean of a numeric variable and the
mean of a logical variable.

It returns NA value when I tried to take the mean of a character
variable and a factor variable.

Change to numeric variable

``` r
#logical variable
as.numeric(df1$b)
```

    ##  [1] 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1

``` r
#character variable
as.numeric(df1$c)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
#factor variable
as.numeric(df1$d)
```

    ##  [1] 3 1 2 2 1 3 3 1 2 3

The logical variable changes to string with values of 1 and 0, with True
being 1 and False being 0. This explains why the logical variable has a
numeric mean whey I tried to take one.

The character variable becomes a string of NA value, with the error
“NA’s introduced by coercion”. This explains that why the character
variable does not have a mean when I tried to take one.

The factor variable changes to string with values of 1, 2, and 3.Before
applying as.numeric function, I cannot take the mean of the factor
variable. However, since it is a three-level factor variables, it can be
interpreted as reasonable numeric value and thus can be calculated for
mean.
